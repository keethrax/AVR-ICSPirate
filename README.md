# AVR-ICSPirate
A simple adapter board going from the Bus Priate 10 pin ribbon to the 6 you actually need for ICSP.

This is really just for convenience in some circumstances. The 6 pin connector can be male or 
female depending on intended use. For example you want to run jumpers to a breadboard or a 
ribbon to an ICSP header on a device.
